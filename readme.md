# Hey, Julia!
I hope you are doing well.  
I could not run your project because I think you still a little bit confused about the React Native sintax.  
The first point to know is that you can not use the same sintax of HTML in React Native, as you've made on the App.js file.  

So, I have some considerations about your project and your knowledge about React Native. Let's see:
1. You must to review the sintax of React Native. You can find it in the first topic of the 1st theme of the digital content and in the official documentation of React Native.
2. Without knowledge about those basic topics, you can not continue with your project. You must to review the basic topics of React Native before continue.
3. You haven't used componentization in your project. You must to use it to make your code more readable and reusable.

I think it's good to get back to the beggining of the course and review the basic topics of React Native.

I want to see your repository again before the deadline of the project.
## Your next delivery to me will be in two weeks, on the 3r of November, 2022.
You chat me on WhatsApp if you have any questions and also to send me your repository again.
